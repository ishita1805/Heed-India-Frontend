                <h3>On a mission to provide and aid</h3>
                <p>
                In 2012 HEED India started as Samarpan Charitable Trust engaging in a number of philanthropic activities with 
                the key philosophy of 'Responsible Living', i.e., responding to the immediate and essential needs of various 
                communities. With these efforts HEED India has reached out to schools, urban and rural communities, especially 
                students, women, SHG groups, elderly and disabled and others aiding them in areas of healthcare, education, 
                livelihood, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                Through the years, HEED India programmes have matured and are moving to a more structured approach of community 
                development. Moving from a need based philanthropic approach to the right mix of need-based & project-based 
                approach, is what drives HEED Indiaâ€™s endeavours.
